# Gradle - Built it Bigger

This is an Android app that demonstrates advanced knowledge of the Gradle build tools, created as part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). This project uses multiple flavors, libraries, and a Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) server as the backend. Factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Free and paid flavors using a shared code base.
- Factor reusable functionality into a Java library.
- Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library.
- Configure a multi project build to compile the libraries and app.
- Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend.
- Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server.
